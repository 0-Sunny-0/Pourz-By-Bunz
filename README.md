## Description

Let's go on a creative journey into the mind of a girl gone mad, a girl forever trying to find her way; expressing how she feels internally through various mediums. Some of it won't make sense and some of it will. But I truly hope you enjoy what you see and if you don't, that's okay too. ðŸ’›
